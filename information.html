        <h1> Morphing blocks </h1>
        <p> This snip from the blender creator is from one of the many tools I used to make my 3D model. This tool allowed me to change the shape and size of each block. It allowed me to do this by letting me change the X,Y and Z coordinates of each block and make them as long and short or as big or small as i needed them to be.</p>

        <h1> Colour tools </h1>
        <p> This snip from the blender creator is of the colour changer. This is one of the many tool options I had in blender but this one was one of the key tools as it hepled me to convey one of the three design elements we needed to incorperate into our 3D model (the one it helped me convey being colour). it let me change the colour by choosing what colour i wanted from the colour wheel it made avalible. </p>
