        <h1>Trike 3D model</h1>
        <p>For the deazzlemebreif internal i had to make a 3D model. The model had to fit a specific criteria of having at least three design elements in it. The design elements im using are shape, colour and size. even though I decided only to use one kind of shape for my 3D object (squares) i did manipulate the length and width of them through blender to make them into the desired shape I wanted them to be. I also used the design element of shape to make my triceratops look proportionally accurate to the actual dinosaur. Being able to manipulate the squares also helped with getting the desired shapes for the model to be accurate. the last element I incorperated into my 3D object was colour. I went for a brown colour for the body as this is was the colour of the triceratops in my reference image. Then I used white for the horns as again that is what my refernce image portrayed. i changed the colour of my objects through blender (see making page). </p>
