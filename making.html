        <p> in this 1st stage of making my 3D model I had to find the shape that I wanted to bulid my trike. I started off with a rectangle block that i decided to use as a leg.</p>

        <h1> 2nd stage of making</h1>
        <p> In this stage I had to copy and paste the legs for my trike 4 times to get the right amount of legs. I then used the one of the legs and changed the width and height of it (see information page) to create the body. </p>

        <p> In this stage of my model I had morphed two more of my pieces. The first peice I elongated into the tail for my trike. The second piece I turned into a cube to use as the base of the head for my model. </p>

        <h1> 4th stage of making</h1>
        <p> In this stage I used and morphed four different blocks. The first block I morphed I turned into the fril at the back of the Triceratop's head. The second block I made smaller and thinner to put at the front of my model to make the snout. The third block I duplicated and turned them on an angle to make the back horns. The last block I used I just made shorter then the other two and made it the front horn. </p>
